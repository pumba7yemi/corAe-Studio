# DEPRECATED — archived. Original file disabled to enforce policy; kept for reference.
<# Disabled: 150-ensure.ps1
   The active PowerShell script has been disabled to enforce the repository-wide
   ban on .ps1 files until '150 logic' policy is accepted. This file intentionally
   exits early so it cannot be executed.
