# SIL Structural Rule

Before creating ANY new route, component, API surface, or app, CAIA must call the SIL Router.
If SIL returns a known domain with high certainty, the system must route or merge into that domain
instead of creating a duplicate. This applies to Workflow Partners, Subject 1, and CAIA itself.

This rule is protected by the Cassandra engine and the 150-Logic Constitution.
