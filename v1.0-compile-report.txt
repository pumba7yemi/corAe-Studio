## Summary
This report outlines the compile and dependency issues identified across the `/apps/studio`, `/packages`, and `/core` directories. The issues are grouped by package, with suggested fixes provided where applicable.

---

## Issues by Package

### `/apps/studio`

#### File: `app/api/ship/business/oms/obari/booking/route.ts`
- **Line 75**: `Type '"inbound" | "outbound" | undefined' is not assignable to type '"inbound" | "outbound"'.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Ensure `snap.direction` is always defined before assignment.

#### File: `app/ship/page.tsx`
- **Line 6**: `Cannot find module 'framer-motion' or its corresponding type declarations.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Install the missing dependency: `npm install framer-motion`.
- **Line 73**: `Parameter 'e' implicitly has an 'any' type.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Add a type definition for `e`.
- **CSS Warnings**:
  - Optimize Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `!bg-slate-900/60` → `bg-slate-900/60!`).

#### File: `app/api/ship/business/oms/obari/invoice/issue/route.ts`
- **Line 9**: `Cannot find module 'pdf-lib' or its corresponding type declarations.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Install the missing dependency: `npm install pdf-lib`.

### `/packages`

#### File: `workflows-core/wizard/caia-bridge.ts`
- **Line 12**: `Cannot find module 'zod' or its corresponding type declarations.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Install the missing dependency: `npm install zod`.

---

### `/core`

#### File: `lib/db.ts`
- **Line 12**: `Cannot find module '@prisma/client' or its corresponding type declarations.`
  - **Suggested Fix**: Install the missing dependency: `npm install @prisma/client`.

---

## Proposed Build Scripts
- **Missing Scripts**: Consider adding build scripts for the following:
  - `/apps/studio`: Add a `build` script in `package.json` to compile TypeScript files.
  - `/packages`: Add a `build` script to handle package-specific builds.

---

## Next Steps
1. Address the unresolved imports by installing the missing dependencies.
2. Fix type errors by adding appropriate type definitions.
3. Optimize Tailwind CSS classes as suggested.
4. Review and implement the proposed build scripts.
