Onboarding Script Builder
=========================

What it does
------------
The person script builder generates initial OS scripts for a persona after onboarding. It creates idempotent, system-marked files under `persons/<slug>/scripts/` for the spheres the persona uses (home, work, business).

Where files are written
----------------------
- `corAe-Studio-v2/persons/<slug>/scripts/home/...`
- `corAe-Studio-v2/persons/<slug>/scripts/work/...`
- `corAe-Studio-v2/persons/<slug>/scripts/business/...`

Idempotency and safe edits
--------------------------
Files generated by the tool are prefixed with the marker `// corAe:system-generated` on the first line. If you want to take full control of a file, remove that marker — future regenerations will skip files without the marker.

Tool location
-------------
`corAe-Studio-v2/tools/person-script-builder.mts` exports `buildPersonScripts(core)`.

Notes
-----
- The onboarding route calls the builder after creating `persons/<slug>/profile.json`. If the builder fails, onboarding still succeeds; failures are logged to `tools/decision-record.mjs` when available.
- This system uses filesystem state only; there are no DB migrations.
