Accountability Inversion — Work/Business Principle:

Systems act. Owners lead.

If the system detects uncertainty, the system resolves it.

Owners are not re-asked technical questions; execution responsibility belongs to the machine, not the human.

This eliminates repetitive decision prompts and enforces zero-decision workflows.
