# corAe Governance — Canonical Index

This folder is the single source of truth.

Order of authority:
1) GOVENANCE/core (global laws)
2) GOVENANCE/subject1 (Subject 1 overrides / additions)
3) GOVENANCE/ships/<ship> (ship-specific deltas)

CAIA must read Governance BEFORE:
- generating Have-You logic
- generating 3³DTD
- building TimeSense day plans
- routing CIMS tasks
- any ZDE execution

No app may override core/subject1 without explicit Subject-1 governance update.

## Core Addenda
- NO_QUESTIONS_EXECUTION.md — NQBE law (stop questions, best-effort ship green).
