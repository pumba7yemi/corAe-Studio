# corAe Ship Governance Law (SGL-SHIP-01)

This law governs how **clients and ships** are allowed to create and grow inside corAe OS².

Purpose:
- Protect the corAe brand and structure.
- Prevent "ugly growth" and chaotic sprawl.
- Ensure all onboarding-created flows remain **contained, legible, and aligned**.

---

## 1. Ship Governance Profiles

Each ship must declare a **governance profile**:

- `STRICT` – Limited creation; template-only. For small operators and first deployments.
- `STANDARD` – Normal creation; template-first with caps and health checks.
- `LAB` – Experimental; for Subject 1 and approved partners only.

Profiles determine:
- How many flows can be created.
- Which modules can be customised.
- Whether sensitive categories (faith, mental health, legal, finance) are allowed at all.

## 2. Creation Rules

1. **Template-First**
   - All user-created flows must start from an approved template.
   - No free-form schema design in shipped environments.

2. **Max Active Items**
   - `STRICT`: small, fixed caps (e.g. up to 10 active flows).
   - `STANDARD`: higher caps (e.g. up to 50 active flows).
   - `LAB`: configurable, still monitored.

3. **Archive Before Add**
   - When a ship hits its cap, it must archive or consolidate existing flows before adding new ones.
