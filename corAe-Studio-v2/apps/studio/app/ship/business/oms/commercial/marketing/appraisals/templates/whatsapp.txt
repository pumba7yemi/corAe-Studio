Hi {{CONTACT}}, I’m David from corAe.

We help {{SECTOR}} firms move from email-and-task friction to AI-run, director-led operations in 30–90 days.

Why this might matter for {{COMPANY}}:
• Sector-common challenges: tasks across email, manual renewals/maintenance, delayed reporting
• corAe automates routine work (maintenance triage, tenant replies, renewals, docs)
• Pulse dashboard gives directors live KPIs at a glance

Built on real business experience, realized with contained AI.
Open to a 10-minute intro this week?

— David
