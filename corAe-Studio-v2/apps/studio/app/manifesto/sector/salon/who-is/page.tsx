      <p className="opacity-80">
        The Salon OS is structure for creativity — a digital system designed to
        free stylists, colorists, and beauticians from chaos and repetition.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-80">
        It brings together bookings, stylist rosters, product tracking,
        finances, and client care under one rhythm. Each salon runs its own
        unique brand, but the flow beneath stays corAe.
