      <p className="opacity-80">
        The Hotel OS is an all-in-one hospitality management system engineered
        to bring structure, clarity, and control to hotel operations. It unifies
        guest services, housekeeping, kitchen, maintenance, and finance into one
        smooth, intelligent workflow.

        From booking to checkout, every action is tracked, measured, and aligned
        with the hotel’s brand standards — ensuring a consistent guest
        experience powered by corAe’s intelligent logic and automation.
