      <p className="opacity-80">
        The Hotel OS is the digital heart of hospitality — structure designed to
        deliver seamless guest experiences, operational clarity, and financial
        control. It empowers teams to serve better by connecting front desk,
        housekeeping, kitchen, and management into one rhythm.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-80">
        Built on the corAe foundation, it harmonises bookings, check-ins,
        service requests, room inventory, and reporting — replacing fragmented
        systems with a single flow of truth. Every reservation becomes a
        structured journey from arrival to checkout.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-80">
        Whether boutique or chain, the Hotel OS adapts to scale, maintaining
        brand individuality while keeping operational precision at its core.
