      <p className="opacity-80">
        The Supermarket OS is the digital backbone for modern retail — designed
        to replace guesswork with rhythm. It brings structure to every shelf,
        aisle, and vendor relationship.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-80">
        Born from real-world supermarket operations, it organises daily stock
        control, purchase orders, expiry tracking, and vendor cycles into a
        precise, repeatable flow — so managers lead with data, not chaos.
      </p>

      <p className="opacity-80">
        Each store runs independently yet shares a common intelligence powered
        by corAe. From cashier terminals to finance dashboards, every movement
        is connected.
